## Overview
The prediction of Exam Marks of a student based on student performance will give a boost in preparation for the meritorious student and put more effort, focus on poor students so that can improve their performance in exams.


 
 ## Problem_Definition
 Education is one of the most important aspects of human resource development. Poor performance in exams not only results in the student having low self-esteem but also causes significant stress to the parents.

## Model_Building

## Result
*  Reading score, writing score,  group D, high school, some high school, standard are key features to drive student's performance in maths.
*  Model Accuracy - 70%  - need more feature engineering and apply various algorithm models.

## Business_Recommendation
* To improve the score in maths, students should focus on reading and writing score.
